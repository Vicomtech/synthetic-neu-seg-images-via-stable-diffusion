# Synthetic NEU-Seg Images via Stable Diffusion

This dataset accompanies the paper "State-of-the-art Diffusion Models to Improve the Robustness of Visual Defect Segmentation by Semantic Networks in Manufacturing Components".

The dataset will be made available upon the paper's acceptance and request for the data, filling the form at:

(to be updated when approved)

# Usage

The dataset is organized in the same way as the original NEU-seg dataset: the images folder contains the synthetic images of the defects, and the annotations folder contains the pixel-level annotations of each. The class values of the pixels in the masks are assigned as follows: 0. Background, 1. Patches, 2. Inclusion, 3. Scratches. Each image/annotation filename is self-descriptive, with regards to the class it belongs to.
